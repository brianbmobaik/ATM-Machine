## My Notes
### Since visualizing this into code is hard I'm using this as my notes

Selected LED Digit:
    - Blink with period of 1/2 second ( Can change if it's too fast/slow )
    - Should toggle between value and off

Buttons:
    - Up/Down = add/sub value
    - Left/Right = select left/right LED Digit
